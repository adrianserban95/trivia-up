# TriviaUp

#### This project is a trivia quiz website. Players are able to register and log in using their email and password.

#### Once they log in, they can start a new quiz choosing the number of questions, category and difficulty.  A total of 24 categories are available including General Knowledge, Geography, History and Science and up to 50 questions can be included in a single quiz.

#### "Hall of Fame" is available for players to check where they rank compared to all daily plays. A custom query can be created inputting the number of questions, category, difficulty and wrong answers to gather TOP 50 results.

#### A third-party API by Open Trivia Database is used to pull in trivia questions.
